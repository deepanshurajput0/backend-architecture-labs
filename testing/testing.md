## What is Testing ?

Testing is the process of verifying that your code works correctly.

## ðŸ”¸ Types of Testing:

### Unit testing 

Test a single function in isolation (no DB or network).

### End-to-End (E2E)

Test the full app as a user would (frontend to backend to DB).


## ðŸ”¹ 2. Why Testing is Important

âœ… Catches bugs early.

âœ… Safer code refactoring.

âœ… Ensures reliability.

âœ… Saves time in long term.

âœ… Used in real companies and CI/CD pipelines.

## Concepts in Testing

âœ… Mocking

    Replacing real code (e.g., DB calls) with fake/stubbed versions.

    Mock DB methods: findOne, findMany, etc.

    Helps isolate what you're testing.

    Prevents hitting real services.
