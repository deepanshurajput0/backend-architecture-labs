# What is Clustering In Node Js

Clustering in Node.js is a technique used to take advantage of multi-core systems. Node.js is single-threaded by default, meaning it runs on a single CPU core. However, with clustering, you can spawn multiple instances (child processes) of your Node.js application, each running on its own core, allowing your app to handle more load concurrently.
