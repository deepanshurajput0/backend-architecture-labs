### What is Internet

The internet is a global network of computers and other electronic devices that are connected together, allowing them to communicate, share information, and access services.

### History of internet 

The internet started as a U.S. military research project called ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network).

The goal was to create a decentralized communication system that could survive a nuclear attack.

First message sent: "LOGIN" ‚Äî but it crashed after "LO".

### How ARPANET Was Formed

In the 1960s, during the Cold War, the U.S. Department of Defense wanted a way for computers to communicate and share data across long distances ‚Äî even if some parts of the network were destroyed (like in a nuclear attack).  
So, they funded a research project through an agency called ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency), now known as DARPA.

### Idea of Packet Switching (1960s)


In the 1960s, two key scientists revolutionized data communication:

- **Paul Baran** (USA)
- **Donald Davies** (UK)

They introduced the concept of **Packet Switching**:
- Breaks data into small units called **packets**.
- Each packet is sent independently through the network.
- Packets are reassembled at the destination.
- Benefits: Faster, more efficient, and fault-tolerant communication.

### What are nodes 

**Nodes** are devices connected to a network. These can:
- Send data
- Receive data
- Forward data

**Examples of nodes**:
- Computers
- Printers
- Routers
- Switches
- Smartphones

### What is router 

A router is a networking device that connects two or more computer networks ‚Äî such as local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs) ‚Äî and manages the flow of data packets between them.  
Its main function is to forward data packets to their correct destination based on their IP addresses, ensuring that information sent over the internet or between networks reaches the right device.

## üè´ First Nodes of ARPANET (1969)

The first routers used in ARPANET were called **IMPs (Interface Message Processors)**, built by **BBN Technologies**.

Four initial universities were connected:

| # | Institution | Location |
|---|-------------|----------|
| 1 | UCLA (University of California) | Los Angeles, CA |
| 2 | SRI (Stanford Research Institute) | Menlo Park, CA |
| 3 | UCSB (University of California, Santa Barbara) | Santa Barbara, CA |
| 4 | University of Utah | Salt Lake City, UT |
