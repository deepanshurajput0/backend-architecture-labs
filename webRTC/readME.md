# WebRTC 

## What is Webrtc 

WebRTC is the core/only protocol that lets you do real time media communication from inside a browser.

You use WebRTC for applications that require sub second latency. 
Examples include

    Zoom/Google meet (Multi party call)

    Omegle, teaching (1:1 call)

    30FPS games (WebRTC can also send data)


## P2P

WebRTC is a peer to peer protocol. This means the you directly send your media over to the other person without the need of a central server


You do need a central server for signalling and sometimes for sending media as well (turn). Weâ€™ll be discussing this later
